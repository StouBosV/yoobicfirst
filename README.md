<p>In my opinion my styling is close enough to the original design. I could have done them look almost the same by using common HTML elements But I have tried to experiment a litle bit and use as many Ionic Components as i could in order to see/learn how they work and interact with eachother. Also every icon i used, is from ionic. I couldn't find exactly the same icons so i used similar!</p>
